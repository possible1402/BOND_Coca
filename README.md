This repo contains code for paper in ICADL2022 [Distantly Supervised Named Entity Recognition with Category-Oriented Confidence Calibration]

## Description
In this work, we study the noisy-labeled named entity recognition under distant supervision setting. We propose a **category-oriented confidence calibration(Coca) strategy** with an automatically confidence threshold calculation module. We integrate our method into a teacher-student self-training framework **[BOND](https://github.com/cliang1453/BOND)** to improve the model performance.

## Environment

Python 3.7, Pytorch 1.11, Hugging Face Transformers v2.6.0.

## Training & Evaluation

We used four weakly labeled NER datasets provided by BOND: conll2003, wikigold, webpage, twitter and one distant dataset BC5CDR generated by the dictionary provided by [AutoNER](https://github.com/shangjingbo1226/AutoNER/tree/master/data/BC5CDR). The training scripts for all five open-domain distantly/weakly labeled NER datasets are in [Scripts](Scripts).
